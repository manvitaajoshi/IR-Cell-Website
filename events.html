          On February 20, 2021, the IIC S.P.I.T in collaboration with Industry
          Relations Cell S.P.I.T conducted an online webinar - ‘A Day in the
          Life of a Google Engineer’, wherein the speaker, Mr.Prasad Pagade, a
          senior architect at Google gave us a peek into his thrilling life
          working at a top Silicon Valley company. Mr.Pagade graduated as a
          Bachelor of Engineering in Electronics from Mumbai University and
          completed his post-graduate studies in the field of Information
          Systems from Santa Clara University. Mr.Pagade has worked for
          corporations such as Infosys, Moody’s Corporation, Deloitte, Google
          and Looker. While having a large breadth of skills, Mr.Pagade’s chief
          interests lie in Data Analytics.<br /><br />Mr.Pagade first gave us a
          deep look at one of the companies he’s working at, Looker - an online
          data platform where he is a senior consultant. Looker plays a vital
          role in real-time visualization of the data of a company, in order to
          spot trends and anomalies. A number of organizations have made use of
          Looker, including the Oklahoma State government, who utilized Looker’s
          services to use data intelligently in order to reduce the Coronavirus
          cases within the state.<br /><br />Having given us a very deep insight
          into the Looker platform, Mr.Pagade shared with us a few thoughts in
          relation to how he built his career. “Always start small.”, he said,
          then adding - “Do not get bogged down by the incessant pressures of
          being a ‘topper’ or an ‘achiever’. Take your time with things but make
          sure you challenge yourself to see where your strengths lie.” He
          emphasized that making a note of your strengths and channeling your
          energy towards that is a key part of developing your career and
          personality as a professional. He then went on to iterate the
          significance of enjoying and cherishing our 4 years in engineering -
          from the great moments to the failures - all of it is pivotal in
          building fortitude of character. “ Sometimes, the little things we do
          may go a long way into developing the skills we need to be a great
          professional or entrepreneur. Playing cricket with my friends built my
          skills as a tactful negotiator, as funny as that sounds!”, said
          Mr.Pagade. <br /><br />
          <img
            style="width: 100%; text-align: center"
            src="Event_Images/2021-02-20 (6).png"
          />
          <br /><br />
          In response to some questions, Mr.Pagade described the impact of his
          postgraduate degree with reference to his career. He informed us of
          the different real-world projects and interactive classes he had the
          benefit of enjoying during his Master’s, including a capstone project
          he worked on in collaboration with a hospital, thereby seeing a real
          difference his work made. When asked about how he got employment at
          Google and what one needs to be a stand-out applicant, he said, “Be
          unique, innovative and true to yourself. Google looks for things
          beyond technical skills - they want to see leadership and creativity.”
          <br /><br />Mr.Pagade then concluded the interaction by thanking the
          participants for their time and interest. The lively and inquisitive
          response of the 120 participants was just a testament to how
          insightful Mr.Pagade was and how enlightening the webinar was. “I’d
          always wondered what it took to be an engineer at Google. Now, thanks
          to this webinar, I have the facts and feel rather inspired to do
          what’s best for my career!”, said Pranav Kumar of SE-IT. The meeting
          ended with Maitri Vora, VP of Industry Relations Cell, SPIT, thanking
          the speaker Mr.Pagade for his time and brilliant insights.

          On April 11, 2021, the IIC S.P.I.T in collaboration with Industry
          Relations Cell S.P.I.T conducted an online webinar - ‘Placement
          Bootcamp’. The speakers were Anukrit Jain, an investment banking
          analyst at JP Morgan and Azain Jaffer, an analyst at Deutsche Bank.
          Both the speakers are alumni of SPIT, each holding a B.Tech in
          Information Technology. <br /><br />The first speaker was Azain
          Jaffer, who gave us a run-down of his experience with non-technical
          placements. Azain stressed the importance of good communication skills
          in building a competitive profile as it pertains to top placements. He
          spoke of the interviews, which are a great test of confidence and
          conviction. “Develop your skills and show confidence in yourself”,
          said Azain, as he detailed the key points interviewers look at - body
          language, confidence and articulate speech. “To be a standout
          candidate, you must engage in extra-curriculars, which are crucial in
          building your leadership and communication skills. Events held by
          clubs such as the debating society can help develop your public
          speaking skills.” Azain also noted that presenting research papers,
          participating in hackathons and cultural fests can also improve one’s
          public speaking. On being asked about how to acquire the relevant
          knowledge for a good financial role, Azain recommended the CFA level 1
          certification syllabus and intangible knowledge gained from case study
          competitions. Azain also personally responded to a few questions
          directed at him. <br /><br />
          <img
            style="width: 100%"
            src="Event_Images/Screenshot (289).png"
          /><br /><br />The next speaker was Anukrit Jain, who was kind enough
          to break down the components of a great resume. He specifically
          emphasized the significance of “knowing your resume inside and out so
          as to answer questions based on it”. He shared his various experiences
          which he felt could be impactful on a resume and noted that not
          everything we do must be on the resume; rather it should be a summary
          of the most relevant experiences to the role or job in question.
          Anukrit also recommended the start-ups at SP-TBI as a great platform
          for gaining experience, be it technical or business-related. He had an
          important message about ‘broadening one’s horizons’ - “Open your mind
          to new avenues and take on new challenges outside of the college
          curriculum. This helps you build your profile and become an attractive
          candidate for organizations”. Anukrit also spent a few minutes while
          talking about the role of LinkedIn in today’s increasingly competitive
          and digital environment. <br /><br />The audience was extremely
          invested in this talk as the speakers were very relatable and provided
          incredible insights. Over 100 students and faculty attended this
          webinar. “It has helped me understand more about non-technical
          placements and has encouraged me to engage in projects and events
          outside the classroom.”, said Arjun Pansare of SE-IT. The speakers
          were pleased with the engagement and active participation of the
          students, with Anukrit saying “Kudos to IR for organizing such a
          practically relevant event”. The meeting concluded with Chairperson of
          the IR-Cell Student Committee, Sayali Ayre thanking the speakers and
          attendees for their time.

          On December 18, the IIC S.P.I.T in collaboration with Industry
          Relations Cell S.P.I.T and E-Cell S.P.I.T, conducted its first event
          since the lockdown, a workshop on Design Thinking and Innovation
          Design. The speaker of the workshop was Mr.Sameer Chavan, a true
          industry expert with over 23 years of experience at leading
          product-based companies building a wide array of applications from
          desktop and mobile to hand-wearable.In addition to his Master’s degree
          from IIT Bombay,Mr.Chavan’s resume includes lead roles in ‘Design’ at
          Flipkart,Intel,LG and Siemens. <br /><br />Design thinking is a
          popular and significant aspect of the process at any great product
          based company. Hence, Mr.Chavan stressed on the importance and true
          execution of design thinking. “Innovation and design goes hand in
          hand” - a rule to live by for any organization. Mr.Chavan alluded to
          the story of the Wright brothers to encourage the audience to
          understand that true innovation requires continuous effort,
          experimentation and the mentality to embrace failure as a learning
          opportunity. Mr.Chavan then went on to discuss an important question -
          ‘Why do some innovations fail while others are successful?’. This time
          he cited the example of Apple’s QuickTake, the world’s first consumer
          digital lens, which was way ahead of its time and did not have any
          impact on the average customer. “Story telling, sketching and
          prototyping are all examples of powerful visual thinking
          methodologies”, said Mr.Chavan. As companies are focusing more towards
          the aesthetics of their product, integrating visual and design
          thinking to an analytical, top down approach is the methodology of the
          future. Design thinking is a bottom-up, human centric process for
          innovation which encourages a ‘fail-fast’ method, keeping in mind the
          user experience. Mr.Chavan then went on to expertly break down the
          various steps an organization or individual must take to integrate a
          design thinking approach into the development process. ‘Empathize,
          Define, Ideate, Prototype and Evaluate’ are the pillars of design
          thinking. Essentially, the entire process revolves around human
          centric thinking, aesthetic simplicity,out-of-the-box problem solving
          and interaction between a corporation and its users. Mr.Chavan
          concluded his presentation and an interactive question-answer session
          was conducted, wherein he covered topics ranging from UX-design to
          project management with emphasis on design thinking ideology.
          <br /><br />
          <img style="width: 100%" src="Event_Images/2020-12-18 (74).png" />
          <br /><br />The workshop was attended by over 60 people and the
          feedback was overwhelmingly positive. “A very illuminating and unique
          workshop. I had never truly considered how crucial design-thinking is
          to the process of innovation!”, said Gaurav Parulekar of SE-IT. The
          meeting concluded with our principal, Dr. B.N Chaudhari and
          chairperson of the IIC, Dr.Kalbande offering Mr.Chavan their gratitude
          for sharing his expert insights and perspective with the students of
          SPIT.

          The Institute Innovation Council (IIC) S.P.I.T. organized a webinar on
          Introduction to Intellectual Property Rights (IPR) on 19th December
          2020. The speaker invited was Prof. Kiran Talele who is an Associate
          Professor in the Electronics Engineering Department of Sardar Patel
          Institute of Technology. He is also the Chief Finance Officer & Head
          of Academic Relations, Sardar Patel Technology Business Incubator,
          Incharge of Innovation & Entrepreneurship Development Centre supported
          by Department of Science & Technology, Government of India.
          <br /><br />The session began with him explaining the basic definition
          of property. He also explained in depth the different kinds of
          property and property rights. Then he delved into what exactly is
          intellectual property rights. He also spoke about different IPR types
          like patent, trademark, copyright, etc, and laid emphasis on the fact
          of how important these are to prevent someone from stealing one's
          brainchild. He took an example of dairy milk chocolate and explained
          the multiple IPRs which it holds. He then moved on to explain patents
          extensively. <br /><br /><img
            style="width: 100%"
            src="Event_Images/2.jpeg"
          />
          <br /><br />
          He spoke about the salient features of patents and what kind of
          innovations can and cannot be patented. He spoke about the different
          acts which were passed by the government Of India over the years of
          patenting. Through an example, he explained hypothetically if we
          wanted to patent that particular product how do we go about it. He
          also threw light on the places where patenting happens and the charges
          of getting one's innovation patent. Similarly, he also shared what is
          copyright and the process and products associated with it. The viewers
          remained engaged from the start till the end and gained some valuable
          information through this webinar. They understood that in the future
          as entrepreneurs if they innovate something new what steps they need
          to follow to protect it through Intellectual Property Rights.
