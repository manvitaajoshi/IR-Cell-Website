<p>
    <br><br>
Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan's Sardar Patel Institute of Technology considered the need to enhance the quality of technical
education to enable graduates to successfully meet the challenges of the 21st century. Keeping this need in mind, IR is
established to bridge the skill gap between institute and industry. <br><br>

The key challenge faced by engineering education today is the need to constantly adapt to the changing requirements of
the industry. The IR cell is also established to identify the expectation and need of the industry and accordingly
promote institutional preparation for meeting those needs by facilitating seminars, workshops, research and development
project, and various other industrial training programs.<br><br>

To improve student's mobility and capability of accepting today's industry need further cause of their absorbance in the
Industry or Research Institute, it is necessary to integrate this expertise if needed in the academics. By looking at
these rapidly changing requirements of the industry, the objective of this Industry Relation Process is to provide a
socially relevant and professional industry environment that will encourage the overall development of a student.
